## Note 
This project is in beta, so things may break! Report issues to https://github.com/tcffan123/G2FM-Installer/issues
## What's this?
This is the repository of the program that installs the [grub2 file manager from me](https://github.com/tcffan123/g2fm-continued), based on the boot loaders Grub4Dos and Grub2 and is suitable for running in BIOS and UEFI-like systems (including UEFI + Secure Boot), and also makes your portable disk multiboot (i.e. after installing on it can write files that are also capable of loading in BIOS-like systems, for example, several ISO images with different operating systems).
## System requirements
- OS: Windows NT 6 (Vista) and higher
- Release v1.2 require Internet connection
## How-to
### Use utility and preparing drive
1. Download and start utility
2. Follow instructions of the program
3. Copy your bootable files on NTFS (no-name) primary
### Booting G2FM
1. Enter to BIOS/UEFI   
_Note: many manufacturers use <kbd>F2</kbd>/<kbd>Del</kbd>/<kbd>F12</kbd> for the menu but in your case the key may be different._
2. Set the __first__ priority for your device with G2FM
3. Save the changes using <kbd>F10</kbd> and confirm it

__Enjoy! ðŸ™‚__
